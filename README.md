# Machine Learning in Production @ CMU


Find resources related to teaching and research on how to build, deploy, assure, and maintain **software products with machine-learned models**. For example, how to integrate a voice-to-text model and an LLM into a video conferencing product to create automated meeting summaries. We cover the entire lifecycle from a prototype ML model to an entire product deployed in the real world, not just models or notebooks. Covers also the **responsible ML engineering** of such systems (safety, security, fairness, transparency) and **MLOps**. 

All materials (book, slides, assignments, bibliography) are released under creative commons licenses. We hope that this fosters teaching and research on these topics.

## The Pitch

The following talk motivates the entire endeavor, explains the need to focus on engineering the entire system, not just the model, and runs through what this means from the lens of quality assurance (model testing to system testing):

We teach a 12-unit course at Carnegie Mellon University on this topic, open to undergraduates and graduate students. We expect some minimal machine learning background and some programming skills, but no prior software engineering research. The course is always offered in the spring semester and often also in the fall.

</a></span>


A curated set of open source products that use machine learning. These are all end-user products that incorporate machine learning models, not libraries, research prototypes, or notebooks. We hope that this lists facilitates research on building products beyond the model-centric view of analyzing ML components: [https://github.com/mlip-cmu/awesome-ml-products](https://github.com/mlip-cmu/awesome-ml-products). For more applications also see this list of [Open Source Android Apps with LLMs](https://github.com/kimberlyhau/LLM-enabledAndroidAppsReplicationPackage).


## Related Courses at CMU

* 17-649 Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering: This course focuses on how AI techniques can be used to build better software engineering tools and goes into more depth with regard to specific AI techniques, whereas we focus on how software engineering techniques can be used to build AI-enabled systems. Our application scenarios are typical web-based systems for end users, rather than tools for software developers.
* [05-318 Human-AI Interaction](http://www.humanaiclass.org/): Focuses on the HCI angle on designing AI-enabled products. Overlaps in some coverage on fairness, covers in much more detail user interface design and how to involving humans in ML-supported decisions, whereas this course focuses more on architecture design, requirements engineering, and deploying systems in production. Both courses are complementary.
* [17-646 DevOps: Modern Deployment](https://mse.isri.cmu.edu/applicants/course-offerings.html), [17-647 Engineering Data Intensive Scalable Systems](https://mse.isri.cmu.edu/applicants/course-offerings.html), and similar: These course cover techniques to build scalable, reactive, and reliable systems in depth. We will survey DevOps, and big data systems in the context of designing and deploying systems, but will not explore them in as much detail as a dedicated course can. We will look at MLOps as a ML-specific variant of DevOps.

We assume a basic understanding of such techniques and processes (see prerequisites) but focus on the engineering process for production ML systems.

We will cover these topics in a two-week segment among many others.
